## Detecting Fake News Using Deep Learning

##### by Avinash Chandrasekaran

The goal of this project is to examine different approaches to accurately classify "fake news" using natural language processing ("NLP") methods on the text of news articles. I rely on two data sets that were generated in a previous research project. I compare two different NLP approaches to fake news detection:  machine learning on engineered features, and deep learning on word embeddings.

1) ling_model.ipynb: implements machine learning on engineered features

2) model.ipynb: implements deep learning on word embeddings
